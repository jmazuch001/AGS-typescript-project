<!-- BONUS: Explain why it's a good idea to ignore compiled files in Git -->

<!-- 1.) 
    You may not necessarily want particular files versioned in your repository, 
    which can include backup files. It also makes a long list of tracked 
    files (via git status) easier to interpret (from a human perspective) 
    and follow through with committing, minimizing user error. 
-->

<!-- 2.) 
    It can make it easier to recover if you accidentally commit a file
    simply by removing the file and amend the previous commit. 
        git rm build
        git commit --amend
